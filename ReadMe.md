<h1>DccwBypassUAC</h1>

This exploit abuses the functionality of "dccw.exe" so as to obtain an administrator shell (bypass UAC). Currently, only supports 64 bit Window systems (only tested on Windows).

In the following days more updates will be uploaded, even a Metasploit version.

To develop the exploit, I have based on those created by:<br>
	- Fuzzysecurity: https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/tree/master/Bypass-UAC.<br>
	- Cn33liz: https://github.com/Cn33liz/TpmInitUACBypass.<br>
Many thanks to you!
